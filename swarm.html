          <h1>What is a bee swarm?</h1>
          A large number of bees – up to 15 or 20,000 from the originating colony seeking a new<br/>
          home. Sometimes seen in flight as a large 'cloud' of flying insects – which may be quite<br/>
          noisy and scary to the observer, but a swarm might be found more often temporarily<br/>
          resting in a large cluster on a bush, car, fence, wall, or any other object.<br/>
          <h1>Why do they swarm?</h1>
          Swarming is the natural way for bees to propagate and expand the species.<br/>
          <h1>When do they swarm?</h1>
          Usually around May – but a few weeks either side is not unheard of. Since the start of<br/>
          spring the queen has been laying up to a 1,000 eggs each day, and the colony starts to get<br/>
          very crowded. This triggers the bees to raise a new queen and the old queen departs from<br/>
          the hive with a significant number of older bees to form a swarm.<br/>
          <h1>Where do they go?</h1>
          The bees evolved over thousands of years to make their natural homes in a hole in a tree<br/>
          or cliff, but since we no longer have swathes of forest for them to live in, the closest to their<br/>
          natural habitat that they will find (unless captured and hived by a beekeeper) is a hole in<br/>
          someones roof, wall, chimney, post box, bird box, shed – anywhere with a bit of protection<br/>
          for them to set up home! As soon as they have settled, the bees will start producing<br/>
          beeswax and making new combs. The old queen will start laying eggs within a few days<br/>
          and the new colony will work overtime to increase their numbers and store enough food to<br/>
          get them through the following winter.<br/>
          <h1>What about the original old colony?</h1>
          Still comprising of up to 20,000 younger bees, the new queen will hatch out a few days<br/>
          after the swarm has left and, after a successful mating flight, will start laying eggs at a<br/>
          prodigious rate. By August the colony may number around 60,000 individuals!<br/>
          <h1>Capturing a swarm.</h1>
          Depending on the location of the swarm, a beekeeper will aim to get the bees into a<br/>
          container that can be sealed for transportation. If easily accessible, it may be possible to<br/>
          knock the swarm into a cardboard or wooden box and leave to settle for a while. Less<br/>
          accessible swarms may require the use of a bee vacuum to suck them into a container.<br/>
          Swarms that are already in very difficult locations – chimneys, cavity walls, etc. - are likely<br/>
          to be beyond the capabilities of most beekeepers and may require more specialist<br/>
          attention to remove.
